They're closing Spark AR on Jan 14th 2025

In its last days Im making a Chrome extention for something that was missing from the platform from the start...

There is a tag that is "Needs update" on some effects but there never was an option to see/filter the effects that need an update.

Now, although late, there is :)

Try it out:

How to load the extension into Chrome:

1.Open chrome://extensions/ in your browser.

2.Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner.

3.Click on "Load unpacked" and select folder with unzipped extention files.
